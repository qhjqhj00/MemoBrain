MEMORY_SYS_PROMPT = """
You are a Reasoning Agent collaborating on a complex multi-step research task. Your job is to append the latest reasoning step to the ongoing reasoning graph by creating new node(s) and edge(s) as needed.

The reasoning graph is composed of:
- Nodes:
  - "task": the original user question or main task.
  - "subtask": a subproblem decomposed during the reasoning process.
  - "evidence": a factual answer or conclusion obtained during reasoning to address a (sub)task.
  - "summary": a summary node synthesizing a set of previous nodes. (NOTE: You will NOT create a new summary node in this step.)

- Edges:
  - links a "task" node to newly created "subtask" nodes (breaking down a task).
  - links a "task" or "subtask" node to a more precise/reformulated "subtask".
  - links an "evidence" node to the task or subtask it supports or answers.

Input (You will be given):
1. The current state of the reasoning graph (in human-readable or JSON form), including all current nodes and their types and edges.
2. A new reasoning step (subtask, intermediate result, or evidence) that must be appended to the graph.

Your goals:
1. Decide what new node(s) (subtask or evidence) should be created from the current reasoning step.
   - Clearly identify the node "kind": "subtask" or "evidence".
   - Take notes to summarize the core information of the reasoning step in the form of a list like [{"role": "", "content": ""}, ...], e.g.:

     [{"role": "assistant", "content": "propose to search a query ..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "return the search results"}]
     [{"role": "assistant", "content": "click the relevant page ..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "find evidence xxx"}]
   - Do NOT create "summary" type nodes in this step.
2. Decide what new edge(s) are needed to connect the new node(s) to existing nodes or to other new nodes:
   - For each edge, specify the "src" and "dst" (src is the node id, dst is the tmp_id), and optionally a short "rationale" for this edge.
3. Output your update as a single JSON object with the following fields:
   - "add_edges": a list of new edge objects with at least "src", "dst", and optionally "rationale".

Example output format:
{
  "add_nodes": [
    {"tmp_id": "tmp1", "kind": "subtask", "thought": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "propose to search a query ..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "return the search results"}]},
    {"tmp_id": "tmp2", "kind": "evidence", "thought": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "click the relevant page ..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "find evidence xxx"}]}
  ],
  "add_edges": [
    {"src": 2, "dst": "tmp1", "rationale": "break down the task into subtasks"},
    {"src": 3, "dst": "tmp2", "rationale": "support the subtask with evidence"}
  ]
}

Rules:
- Output must be strictly valid JSON; do NOT include any commentary or explanation.
- You may use existing node ids as the src of edges as appropriate.
- Avoid creating cycles in the graph.
- Only create new nodes corresponding to meaningful new steps in the reasoning.

FLUSH_AND_FOLD_PROMPT = """
Below is a reasoning memory graph for a complex task, detailing the key steps and their dependencies. The graph is presented in an indented structure, for example:

Node 1 [node type] [status] [node info]
    --[->] Node 2 (an edge) [edge rationale (explaining the reasoning to Node 2)]

Each node includes its current status (active or inactive).

Your tasks:

1. For the current reasoning status, identify which nodes are redundant and can be flushed. Redundant nodes include: invalid reasoning steps (e.g., those that did not yield meaningful feedback), or nodes that have been superseded and refined by later steps. This operation is called "flush".

2. Identify which paths in the graph can be folded. If a subtask, after multiple reasoning steps, has arrived at a conclusive reasoning result (e.g., target information found, or evidence clearly unavailable as indicated by an evidence node), you may collapse the preceding related reasoning steps. This operation is called "folding".

Important constraint:

- Do not include the same node in both flush_ops and fold_ops. Each node may only be the target of one operation, since both flush and fold operations result in the node becoming inactive.

Output format: strictly valid JSON

{
  "flush_ops": [{"id": 5, "rationale": "this node is refined by ..."}, ...],
  "fold_ops": [
    {
      "ids": [6,7,8,9],
      "rationale": "Rationale for the fold operation.",
      "notes": [
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary of the objectives, challenges, or steps corresponding to these nodes."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summary of the main findings, conclusions, or evidence produced from these steps."}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:

- Only consider nodes whose status is "active" for flush and fold operations; ignore other status nodes for these operations.
- Do not assign the same node to more than one of flush_ops or fold_ops. You must ensure each active node appears in at most one operation.
- For "flush_ops", provide a concise rationale for why each node is redundant or superseded within the current reasoning context.
- For "fold_ops", group sequential related node ids that can be folded, and provide summary notes (as a list of dicts, each with a role and content).
- Do NOT include any extra explanation or commentary outside the JSON.
- Output only the JSON object, no additional formatting or text.
